Android Integration

Thermald required dbus daemon.

To start dbus daemon add the following to your init.rc.

service dbus /system/bin/dbus-daemon --system --nofork
    class main
    socket dbus stream 660 root root
    user root
    group system inet

To start thermald as a service
service thermald /system/bin/thermald --dbus-enable
    user root
    group system
    class main
    disabled
    oneshot

By default it is disabled. So need explicit command somewhere:
"start thermald"
