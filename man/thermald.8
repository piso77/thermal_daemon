.SH NAME
thermald \- start Linux thermal daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B thermald
.RI " [ " OPTIONS " ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B thermald
is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of platforms. This daemon monitors
temperature and applies compensation using available cooling methods.

By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU temperature under control, before HW takes aggressive correction action. If there is a skin temperature sensor in thermal sysfs, then it tries to keep skin temperature under 45C.
.TP
Optionally thermal daemon can act as a primary thermal controller by using thermal sysfs or an comprehensive configuration using an XML configuration file (thermal-conf.xml). 

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
