-The terminology used in this file confirms to "Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification". The ACPI thermal model is based around conceptual platform regions called thermal zones that physically contain devices, thermal sensors, and cooling controls. For example of a thermal zone can be a CPU or a laptop cover. A zone can contain multiple sensors for monitoring temperature. A cooling device provides interface to reduce the temperature of a source device, which causes increase in the temperature. An example of a cooling device is a FAN or some Linux driver which can throttle the source device.
